= Endpoints =

Sealious automatically creates endpoints for all the collections defined within
your app. All endpoins automatically take care of policy enforcement, so you
don't have to worry about implementing logic of who can do what. Just make sure
that the policies are set up properly for each collection and they will be
enforced.
